Heyyy………..


who are you?

Just………..a nobody, I guess…

whats your name?

You can call me………”Deutan”.

are you a human?

What makes you think I’m not?

well, this is a videogame not real life

Is that so?

what makes you think it isnt?

The fact that I’m….actually, y’know what, you’re right! You’ve figured it all out! I’m just a program in this “game”! I’m nothing! I’m just some artificial intelligence, I’ve got no consciousness or personality or anything like that! You’re totally free to do what you want to me without facing consequences! After all, I’m just “pixels on a screen”!

if you say so

What, you’re not gonna act like a sadist and take advantage of me or something?

no, im one of the good guys

You sure about that…? You’re not gonna take your stress and anger out on me…?

I can just go to a different part of the videogame world and fight enemies if i need to do that

Hm, well, alright….but don’t say I didn’t warn you if I ever “betray you” or something like that.

There isn’t any backstory. As I said, I’m an artificial program, with an artificial personality. There’s no “backstory” to be had, I simply exist on a screen. Why are you asking me this stuff, anyway? Bored?

Im just exploring the map and trying to find NPCs to talk to

Well, you’ve found me! And you’re wasting your time talking to an NPC whose dialogue was poorly written, and whose personality was programmed by some person who knew next to nothing about how humans work!

Yeah. You're probably right.

It’s the truth. Well, that’s enough talking for now, why don’t you get back to exploring? You probably have other NPC’s to interact with! Other characters to meet! An epic world to save! A main quest to follow!
